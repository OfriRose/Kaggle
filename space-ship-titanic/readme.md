Spaceship Titanic: A Kaggle Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition, a binary classification problem to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension or not. The solution uses a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn.

Dataset

The dataset used is from the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition. It consists of two CSV files: train.csv for training the model and test.csv for making predictions.

Approach

The solution follows a standard machine learning workflow:

    Data Loading: Load the train.csv and test.csv files into pandas DataFrames.

    Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

        Handling Missing Values: Missing numerical values are imputed using the median, while missing categorical values are imputed using the mode.

        Feature Engineering: The Cabin feature is split into CabinDeck and CabinSide to extract more useful information.

        Feature Encoding: Categorical features are converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.

        Column Alignment: A crucial step to ensure the training and test datasets have the same columns and order, which is necessary for the model to work correctly.

    Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is initialized and trained on the preprocessed training data.

    Prediction and Submission: The trained model is used to predict the Transported status for the test set. The predictions are then formatted into a submission.csv file, ready for submission to Kaggle.

Files

    main.py: The main script that performs all the data processing, model training, and generates the submission file.

    submission.csv: The final submission file generated by the script.

    data/: Directory containing the original train.csv and test.csv dataset files.

How to Run

    Clone this repository.

    Ensure you have the required libraries installed: pandas and scikit-learn.

    Place the train.csv and test.csv files from the Kaggle competition into the data/ directory.

    Run the main.py script from your terminal:
    Bash

python main.py

A submission.csv file will be generated in the project root directory. You can upload this file to the Kaggle competition page to get your score.
